### Idioteque - A Minimal Theme for Jekyll
Documentation is currently in the works. If you would like to use the theme prior to official release, please contact me. In the meantime, read about [how I designed and coded this blog](http://anthonyramella.com/blog/new-blog-design/).

Until I get a proper demo page set up, you can see the theme in action at my personal blog [here](http://anthonyramella.com)
