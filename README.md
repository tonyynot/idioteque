### Idioteque - A Minimal Theme for Jekyll
Idioteque is a clean, minimal and easy to use theme for Jekyll. It is designed responsively using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and the Neat grid. Colors and fonts can be easily changed with the defined Sass variables found in _variables.scss. Compiling is handled by Gulp and the settings can be found in the gulpfile.

###Installation
More detailed documentation is currently in the works. If you would like to use the theme prior to official release, please contact me. In the meantime, [this post](http://anthonyramella.com/blog/new-blog-design/) should serve as a guide on how everything works.

Until I get a proper demo page set up, you can see the theme in action at my personal blog [here](http://anthonyramella.com). Please fork and clone this repo if you wish to use the theme.

###User comments
Idioteque handles statically generated user comments with [Staticman](https://staticman.net/). Please visit the site for installation instructions and configuration. In the config.yml file, the settings can be changed in the comments section.
