### Idioteque - A Minimal Theme for Jekyll
Idioteque is a clean, minimal and easy to use theme for Jekyll. It is designed responsively using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and the Neat grid. Colors and fonts can be easily changed with the defined Sass variables found in _variables.scss. Compiling is handled by Gulp and the settings can be found in the gulpfile.

More detailed documentation is currently in the works. If you would like to use the theme prior to official release, please contact me. In the meantime, [this post](http://anthonyramella.com/blog/new-blog-design/) should serve as a guide on how everything works.

Until I get a proper demo page set up, you can see the theme in action at my personal blog [here](http://anthonyramella.com)
